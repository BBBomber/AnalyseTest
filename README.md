# Weather Forecast App

## Project Description

This React website project allows users to search for city names and retrieve weather data using the OpenWeather API. The site also incorporates the GeoDB Cities API to provide autocomplete suggestions for city names based on population. Users can view the current weather conditions as well as a weekly weather forecast for the selected city.

## Features

- **City Search with Autocomplete:** The website offers a city search bar with autocomplete functionality. Users can type the name of a city, and the top 5 results based on population will be suggested.

- **Current Weather Data:** Upon selecting a city from the search results, the site displays the current weather data, including temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed, obtained from the OpenWeather API.

- **Weekly Weather Forecast:** Users can also view a week's weather forecast for the selected city. The forecast includes daily temperature highs and lows, weather conditions, and other relevant information.
